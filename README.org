#+TITLE: An introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp - my journey
#+AUTHOR: Carlos Perez
* Introduction
"An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp" by Robert J. Chassell is a book
included in the Emacs tutorials.
You can find it in Emacs with ~C-h i m~ and search for "Emacs
Lisp Intro".

I am keeping here a record of my notes and solutions to the exercises of the
book and making it public to motivate myself to be organized.
